## About Me

I'm Chilufya Mutaleâ€”Full Stack Developer, designer, and founder of this studio. With a background in Computer Science and years of experience building digital products, I specialize in creating clean, scalable, and user-friendly software.

From front-end design to back-end architecture, I build web experiences that are fast, intuitive, and built to last. I care about performance, usability, and the small details that make big impacts.

This work isnâ€™t just about codeâ€”itâ€™s about helping people bring ideas to life with clarity, craft, and confidence.

## What I Do

At my core, I build **websites and software that work beautifully**. Whether you're a founder with a prototype, an established business looking to level up, or someone with an idea youâ€™re still figuring outâ€”I'll help bring it to life.

Hereâ€™s how I can help:

**Custom Website Design & Development** Fast, responsive websites with a focus on usability, performance, and visual impact.

**Web Applications & MVPs** Scalable, production-ready tools and apps tailored to your business logic.

**CMS Integrations (Sanity, WordPress, etc.)** Dynamic content management for marketing sites or editorial teams.

**UI/UX Design Systems** From Figma to frontendâ€”design systems that stay consistent and scale.

**Technical Consulting** Architecture planning, audits, and strategic guidance for digital projects.

<!-- ## A Bit More About Me

I believe great digital experiences start with empathy and curiosity. I love learning how things workâ€”whether it's a business model or a new JavaScript framework. Outside of code, Iâ€™m probably reading, sketching UI ideas, or helping a friend fix their site.

If you're here just exploring or want to geek out about tech, tools, or designâ€”I'd love to connect.
