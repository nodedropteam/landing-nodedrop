## What I Do

At my core, I build and secure the infrastructure that powers modern web platforms and internal systems. Whether you're launching a product, automating operations, or enhancing network security—I make sure the foundation is solid, scalable, and smart.

Here’s how I can help:

**Network & DNS Infrastructure**  
Domain setup, DNS configuration, SSL management, and network optimization.

**Provisioning & Deployment**  
  Streamlined device imaging, printer and SMTP setup, and automated system rollouts.

**Web Apps & Internal Tools**  
  Build backend-driven MVPs, API-connected dashboards, and business logic applications.

**IT Automation**  
  Automate repetitive tasks using PowerShell, Python, and Power Automate—ticketing, SSO provisioning, lifecycle flows.

**Security & Monitoring**  
  Implement secure access policies (MFA, conditional access), deploy Azure Sentinel, and monitor EDR/IDS activity.

**Reporting & Insights**  
  Deliver real-time visibility with Power BI dashboards, SQL reporting, and custom API integrations.

**Technical Consulting**  
  Infrastructure assessments, cloud migration planning, and policy-based systems design.
